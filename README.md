## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this workshop

This workshop was created by [@rmw](https://github.com/rmw) for GitHub's internal Day of Learning. It was created in response to hearing how non-engineers sometimes struggled with using GitHub.

## üíª Prerequisites

The workshop assumes the following:
- you have a GitHub account. If not, you can [sign up here](https://github.com/signup).
- you are using a Mac. 
  - This workshop _should_ work with Windows just fine, but it has not been thoroughly tested.

## üìö Overview

### :octocat: What is GitHub?
[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is the productive, collaborative, secure platform that developers love.

**GitHub revolutionaized software engineering.** It made finding, contributing and securing [open source](https://github.com/open-source) software much much easier. GitHub gave engineering teams [tools to get feedback](https://github.com/features/code-review), leading to higher quality and more secure code. It made [automation](https://github.com/features/actions) easier, requiring less resources to focus on things like CI/CD, creating releases and [packages](https://github.com/features/packages), and more. Today, GitHub is automating [security](https://github.com/features/security) and bringing the [power of AI](https://github.com/features/copilot) to development.


And it can be intimidating for non-software engineers.
 

**It takes a village to build, maintain, secure, deliver, market, and sell software.** This workshop aims to help demystify a common workflow for everyone else.

### üñäÔ∏è What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language.

Language: text that a computer, with the right tools, knows how to turn into something else. In this case, it turns plain text into pretty text.

Markup: adding special characters (e.g. # or *) to text so that the computer knows how you want to display it. HTML is a also a markup language.

Lightweight: not trying to do it all.

**Why is it useful?**
- Not tied to a specific tool, such as Microsoft Word
- Simple to use
- Easy to read even with the special characters
- GitHub has its own flavor: [GitHub Flavored Markdown or GFM](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
